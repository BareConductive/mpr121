  // The MPR121 allows a mixture of GPIO and touch sense electrodes to be
  // selected for the 12 pins labelled E0..E11, but you can't just pick and
  // choose arbitrarily. The first four electrodes (E0..E3) are always touch
  // sense pins - they can't be anything else. Then you can set the number of
  // GPIO pins from 0 to 8 for the remaining pins. These are set sequentially
  // i.e. if 1 pin is required, this is ALWAYS E11, if 2 pins, E11 and E10
  // and so on up to 8 pins (E11..E4). 
  
  // See p16 of http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/data_sheet/MPR121.pdf

  // electrode has 7 possible pin modes (6 GPIO and 1 touch), so the library is 
  // unable to correctly guess on your behalf. These modes are INPUT, INPUT_PU 
  // (input with internal pullup), INPUT_PD (input with internal pulldown), 
  // OUTPUT, OUTPUT_HS (open collector output, high-side), OUTPUT_LS (open 
  // collector output, low side).

 Bare Conductive MPR121 library
 ------------------------------
 
 GPIOinverter.ino - MPR121 GPIO inverter - reads a pin, outputs the inverse
 
 Based on code by Jim Lindblom and plenty of inspiration from the Freescale 
 Semiconductor datasheets and application notes.

  // The MPR121 allows a mixture of GPIO and touch sense electrodes to be
  // selected for the 12 pins labelled E0..E11, but you can't just pick and
  // choose arbitrarily. The first four electrodes (E0..E3) are always touch
  // sense pins - they can't be anything else. Then you can set the number of
  // GPIO pins from 0 to 8 for the remaining pins. These are set sequentially
  // i.e. if 1 pin is required, this is ALWAYS E11, if 2 pins, E11 and E10
  // and so on up to 8 pins (E11..E4).

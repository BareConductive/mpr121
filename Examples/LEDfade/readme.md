# Bare Conductive Touch Board MPR121 LED Fading Example

Uses the (limited) PWM output feature of the MPR121 on the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/touch-board) to fade an attached LED up and down. Needs an LED with a series current limiting resistor connected between E11 and ground. 470 ohms is good for most LEDs.

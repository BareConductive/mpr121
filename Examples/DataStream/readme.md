# Bare Conductive Touch Board Datastream Example

Continuously reads capacitive sense data from the MPR121 on the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/touch-board) and outputs it to the (virtual) serial port. Can optionally interface with Bare Conductive's [MPR121 grapher](https://github.com/BareConductive/mpr121-grapher).

## Requirements

* [Bare Conductive MPR121 library](https://github.com/BareConductive/mpr121/)

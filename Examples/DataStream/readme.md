# Bare Conductive Touch Board Datastream Example

Continuously reads capacitive sense data from the MPR121 on the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/touch-board) and outputs it to the (virtual) serial port. Can optionally interface with Bare Conductive's [MPR121 grapher](http://link.to/grapher).

##### TODO: diagram? perhaps this doesn't need one
##### TODO: correct link to MPR121 grapher

## Requirements

* [Bare Conductive MPR121 library](../)
